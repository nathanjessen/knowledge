# Remote

## What Works

1. Being given a task with few or no dependencies.
1. Give remote teams/developers tasks that allow them to work autonomously.

## What Doesn't Work

1. Managing a team remotely without previous remote experience.
1. Living in a timezone 8+ hours away.
1. Planning meetings when team members have other obligations (sleeping in the early morning or family commitments in the evening).
1. Lose the ability to turn to a co-worker and ask a quick question.
1. Lose the ability to jump on a whiteboard to explain your idea.

## Advice

1. Give people ownership over something and the autonomy to build it with little initial oversight.
1. Use code reviews, design reviews, and other exercises to ensure people stay on track.
1. Communicate in the open. It's common for a team to communicate in person and make decisions but never communicate the decision to the outside team. Every decision should be documented (Slack, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, or Passport).
1. Establish trust with your team and your organization.
1. Encourage remote work with small steps like working from home or working during travel.
