# Talks

## Preparing a Talk

1. "The Pledge" - Present the audience with a web development problem, explain how it is experienced in real life, and how it has become accepted as part of everyday work.
2. "The Turn" - Give them a reason that thing could be a problem, show them how a proposed solution was conceived, show real working examples with code snippets, and how it could make their apps and development cycle better.
3. "The Prestige" - Give them a solid, real world example that they can take home and play with.
